// This file's commands are now largely superseded by MCP tools.
// If specific UI-only filesystem commands are needed that don't map to MCP,
// they can be re-added here. For now, this file can be simplified or
// its commands can call the MCP tool_impl functions directly if that's desired
// for UI interactions not going through an MCP client.

// For this iteration, we assume UI will eventually use an MCP client or
// these commands will be re-evaluated. Keeping it minimal for now.

// No specific Tauri commands for direct filesystem manipulation are exposed from here
// as they are covered by the MCP tools.
// If you need UI-specific wrappers around MCP logic, define them here.
// Example:
